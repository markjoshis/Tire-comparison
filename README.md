This is the dataset i got after doing the research about the efficiency of the car's tires of 3 following brands: DUNLOP, Good Year and Toyo Tires. 
The research based on the survey of car driver, who own either a Toyota or a Honda car, about their using car's tires. We asked them about how far they can travel with the original tires (the one which belongs to the production of the car when they bought them), and about what type of tires they would choose to replace those tires, after they are expired/unusable, we asked them to choose  1 of 3 tire brands mentioned above. Also, after a period of time, we, again, bring out a survey and ask them about the distance they can travel with the new changing tires. After collecting and sorting, as well as eliminating all the data not relating to our survey. We represent you the dataset of the "Tire Comparison", so you can have a better look on the quality of the tires.
Explanation of the dataset
 + Vehicle: we number all the car in the survey so that viewer can easily view the information corresponding to that car.
 + Type: we also digitlize the two types of car (Toyota and Honda) to the binary one (number "0" and "1") respectively.
 + Usage Time: in the survey also ask them about how long have they used their car, since they bought it.
 + Weight: the weight of the car
 + Initial Distance: the distance that the car can travel with the initial tires
 + New Distance: the distance that the car can travel with the new tires, the changing one
 + Tire alternation: the types of tires that car drive choose to replace the expired ones.

The dataset may be changed because we may collect the newer data and replace it in the file!
